# How to disable middle click within the Linux operating system

This is useful when your mouse pointing device has a scroll wheel that performs as a middle button.  For example, when the wheel is pressed too firmly while rolling to scroll text, a 'paste' activity may occur uncepectedly, potentially adding some and deleting other text.

In the terminal program, type and press enter:

```
xmodmap -e "pointer = 1 25 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10"
```

_NOTE: Throughout this document, after each command (e.g. "xmodmap....10", above), press the {Enter} key._

This will disable the middle click until you log out.

# How to make the change persistent

We want to put that command in an executable file, and then set it to run on login.

1. In the terminal, run these.

   ```
   cd ~/Desktop
   fileContents='xmodmap -e "pointer = 1 25 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10"'
   echo $fileContents > disable_middle_click.sh
   ```
   NOTE: In the previous commands, be sure to have no spacing in: fileContents=

2. Run this command, which sets the file mode for that file to exectuable:  

   `chmod +x disable_middle_click.sh`

3. Set the new file to run at log-in:
     - Press the "Show Applications" button at lower left corner of OS window.
     - Search for "Startup Applications Preferences".  
       (You can do this by simply typing "startup..." and looking through the results that appear.)
     - Click "Add".  A small window will pop-up.
     - Enter these:
         - Name: Disable Middle Click
         - Command: _Click Browse, and navigate to the file on the Desktop_
         - Press the "Add" button to finalize and close the small window.
         - Press "close" to end the "Startup Applications Preferences" window.

7. Log-out and log-in to verify that it works.

## If you wish to re-enable middle click:

```
xmodmap -e "pointer = 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10"
```
