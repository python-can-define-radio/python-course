-  A great, organized set of resources that explains the basics of python and how to use the `arcade` library to make games:
   https://learn.arcade.academy/
   They have an explanations of all of the foundational topics, such as...
   - if statements: https://learn.arcade.academy/en/latest/chapters/10_if_statements/if_statements.html
   - for loops: https://learn.arcade.academy/en/latest/chapters/11_for_loops/for_loops.html
   - functions: https://learn.arcade.academy/en/latest/chapters/08_functions/functions.html


-  Arcade also has some great tutorials, like [solitaire](https://api.arcade.academy/en/latest/tutorials/card_game/).


-  You can make Graphical User Interfaces in Python using [guizero](https://lawsie.github.io/guizero/start/).


- Text User Interfaces (cool, but fairly advanced): https://textual.textualize.io/tutorial/


-  [Egg catcher game](https://github.com/SmallLion/Python-Projects/blob/main/egg_catcher.py). Very easy to reconfigure.


-  Chess in Python, with explanation: https://levelup.gitconnected.com/chess-python-ca4532c7f5a4
   (You may need to provide your own image files)


-  Dictionaries: A very useful data structure.
   Basics: https://realpython.com/python-dicts/
  
  
-  Reading CSV Files: Very practical, because Excel sheets can be saved as CSV for use with python.
   Recommended prerequisite: Dictionaries
   Basics: https://realpython.com/python-csv/
   More advanced: https://realpython.com/python-interview-problem-parsing-csv-files/


-  [Pymunk](http://www.pymunk.org/en/latest/installation.html): Python physics simulator; comes with examples


-  Basics of turtle:
   Basics: https://realpython.com/beginners-guide-python-turtle/
   
   
-  Games made using turtle and the freegames module.
   These are simple enough to be able to make small changes and grasp how some parts of the code work.
   Recommended prerequisite: Basics of turtle
