- https://www.freecodecamp.org/ : Free lessons and certificates.
  - **Top recommendation**: https://www.freecodecamp.org/learn/scientific-computing-with-python/
- https://edube.org/ : Lessons and certificates. Some parts are free.
- https://learn.arcade.academy/ : A great, organized set of resources that explains the basics of python and how to use the `arcade` library to make games. They have explanations of all of the foundational topics, such as [functions](https://learn.arcade.academy/en/latest/chapters/08_functions/functions.html), [if statements](https://learn.arcade.academy/en/latest/chapters/10_if_statements/if_statements.html), and [for loops](https://learn.arcade.academy/en/latest/chapters/11_for_loops/for_loops.html).
- [Python for Everybody (PY4E)](https://www.py4e.com/lessons): Another set of lessons covering all of the basics, and some more advanced topics (fetching data over a network, etc)

### Practice problems
- https://pythonprinciples.com/challenges/
- https://leetcode.com/
- https://codingbat.com/python : This one requires knowledge of functions and return statements. Also, it is running an older version of Python, so you can't use f-strings.
