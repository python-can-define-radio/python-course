## General advice

I recommend that everyone use a password manager. One option is Keeweb. Details near the bottom of this page.

## Resources explaining Public Key Encryption:

## Appendix

### How to set up the Keeweb Password manager

1. https://app.keeweb.info/

2. If you don't have one already, create an online account to sync on any of the supported platforms.
   (Unfortunately, that password is one you'll have to remember since it's the way to get access to your password manager's database.)

3. In Keeweb, click `New` (this is the only time you'll do that)

4. Make a fake entry using the + sign. Fill in some fake data.

5. Click on `New` in the bottom left.

6.
