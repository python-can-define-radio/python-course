      ### How to change terminal timeout (TMOUT variable):
      
      - Activate a Terminal program window in Linux OS.
      - Type and run: `echo -e '\n\nexport TMOUT=30000' >> ~/.bashrc` (this appends `export TMOUT=30000` to the end of the .bashrc file)
      - Verify that it changed the file using this command to view the file: `cat ~/.bashrc`
      - Close all terminals so it'll take effect.
      
      ### Alternate approach to change TMOUT:
      
      Run this Python:
      
      ```python3
      f = open("/home/PUT_YOUR_USERNAME_HERE/.bashrc", "a")
      f.write("\n\n")
      f.write("export TMOUT=300000")
      f.close()
      ```
      
      ### How to change OS screen timeout on Ubuntu:
      
      In Settings, click the magnifying glass in the top left of the window and search `Screen Lock` and select it.
      - Adjust the "Blank Screen" option. Recommended setting: 15 minutes.
      - Adjust the "Automatic Screen Lock Delay". Recommended setting: 30 minutes.

<details><summary>Using the Debugger (Expand for details)</summary>  

### Instructions    
    
The debugger is useful for watching your code as it runs. Thonny's debugger is particularly useful, as it evaluates individual steps within a line of code.

To debug in Thonny, press `Ctrl` + `F5`.

To debug in VS Code, place a breakpoint (a red dot; ask an instructor to demonstrate) on a the line of code on which you'd like to begin debugging (the first line if you aren't sure), and then press `F5`.

For more information on debugging in Thonny, see the [Thonny homepage](https://thonny.org/), or ask an instructor.

For a short video on debugging with Thonny go [here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QQAqQp06nXo).
