      ### How to change terminal timeout (TMOUT variable):
      
      - Activate a Terminal program window in Linux OS.
      - Type and run: `echo -e '\n\nexport TMOUT=30000' >> ~/.bashrc` (this appends `export TMOUT=30000` to the end of the .bashrc file)
      - Verify that it changed the file using this command to view the file: `cat ~/.bashrc`
      - Close all terminals so it'll take effect.
      
      ### Alternate approach to change TMOUT:
      
      Run this Python:
      
      ```python3
      f = open("/home/PUT_YOUR_USERNAME_HERE/.bashrc", "a")
      f.write("\n\n")
      f.write("export TMOUT=300000")
      f.close()
      ```
      
      ### How to change OS screen timeout on Ubuntu:
      
      In Settings, click the magnifying glass in the top left of the window and search `Screen Lock` and select it.
      - Adjust the "Blank Screen" option. Recommended setting: 15 minutes.
      - Adjust the "Automatic Screen Lock Delay". Recommended setting: 30 minutes.
