One of the most powerful uses of programming is the ability to repeat an action, such as automatically sending text messsages to many recipients. One way to accomplish this is the `for` loop. 

```python3
# 1
# Try this:
colors = ["red", "orange", "yellow"]
for color in colors:
    print("Here is a color that I know:")
    print(color)
    print()
```

The line `for color in colors:` is the new part. It means "for each color in my list of colors, do the following actions."

For example, we could greet each name in a list of names:

```python3
# 2
# Try this:
names = ["Sam", "Lisa", "Micah", "Dave"]
for name in names:
    print(f"Hello {name}. Welcome to the Python course.")

    
# 3
# Copy and modify the previous example like so:
# for each name, display "Have a good day, ____. I hope you enjoyed experimenting with python."
# (Fill in the blank with the name.)
```

You can do any operation that you'd like inside of the loop. For example, we could do math on each item in a list:

```python3
# 4
# Try this:
ages = [26, 37, 55, 10, 5]
for age in ages:
    print(f"One of the people in my list is {age} years old.")
    print(f"In two years, that person will be {age + 2} years old.")


# 4b
# Copy and modify the previous example so that for each age,
# it displays "5 years ago, that person was ___ years old."


# 5
# For each of the following numbers, display “Half of __ is ___”. For example, “Half of 21 is 10.5”
numbers = [21, 40, 32, 10, 8, 3]
```

As you've seen, you can use a `for` loop with lists. You can also use a `for` loop with a string. For example:

```python3
# 6
# Try this:
phrase = "Hello world"
for letter in phrase:
    print(f"The letter is {letter}")


# 7
# Copy and modify the previous example so it asks the user for a string (rather than only using "Hello world").


# 7b
# Copy and modify the previous example so it outputs each letter from the user input followed by "!". For example:
# H!
# e!
# l!
# l!
# o!
```

You can also use a `for` loop with a range:

```python3
# 8
# Try this:
for num in range(1,5):
    print(num)
```

You'll notice that `range()` always omits the final number. It may seem odd, but it was an intentional decision in the design of Python (and other languages).

Why? The short explanation is that it helps avoid off-by-one errors.

```python3
# 9
# Modify the previous example to print the numbers 1 to 6.


# 10
# For each of the integers 1 to 5, print that number squared.
# Use the range function.
# (In other words, the lists [1, 2, 3, 4, 5] and [1, 4, 9, 16, 25] should not appear in your code.)


# 11
# Copy and modify the previous example to allow the user to specify the highest number rather than stopping at 5.
# Ex:
# Highest number?  (user types 4)
# 1
# 4
# 9
# 16

# 11b has been moved to 32a, below.

# 11c
# Do you remember the operator that does remainder in Python?
# Use a for-loop to display the following:
#  1 divided by 4 would have a remainder of ____.
#  2 divided by 4 would have a remainder of ____.
# ...
# 10 divided by 4 would have a remainder of ____.
# 11 divided by 4 would have a remainder of ____.
# 12 divided by 4 would have a remainder of ____.
# Here's a hint. You'll most likely change the a, b, and c.
for a in range(b, c):
    print(f"___ divided by 4 would have a remainder of ___")


# 12
# Try this:
print("Hello"*3)


# 13
# Modify the previous example to ask the user how many "Hello"s to print.


# 14a
# Construct the following pattern using a `for` loop.
# Let the user specify how many rows to print.
# AAAAA
# AAAAA
# AAAAA
# AAAAA


# 14aa
# Construct the following using a `for` loop.
# Let the user specify how many rows to print.
# 1 A
# 2 A
# 3 A
# 4 A


# 14aaa
# (optional challenge question)
# Construct the following using a `for` loop.
# Let the user specify how many rows to print.
# 1 times A is A
# 2 times A is AA
# 3 times A is AAA
# 4 times A is AAAA


# 14b
# (optional challenge question)
# Construct the following pattern using a `for` loop.
# Let the user specify how many rows to print.
# A
# AA
# AAA
# AAAA


# 15
# Try this.
temps_in_F = [90, 47, 16, 82, 68, 100, 30, 25, 40]
for temp in temps_in_F:
    print(f"The temperature was {temp}")

    
# 15b
# Try this.
temps_in_F = [90, 47, 16, 82, 68, 100, 30, 25, 40]
for temp in temps_in_F:
    print(f"The temperature was {temp}")
    if temp > 90:
        print("That's hot.")


# 16
# Modify the previous question to display the temperature and display whether it is above or below freezing.


# 17
# Try this:
x = input("Say a word: ")
if x.endswith("s"):
    print("That ends with an 's', so it might be plural.")
print("That's all I have to say.")


# 18
# Modify the previous example so that if the user input ends with "day",
# then the computer will display "I think that's a day of the week."
```

In some cases, you'll update a variable inside of a loop. In the example below, we loop through the strings in the `fruits` list, adding one to `berryCount` every time the variable `fr` ends with "berry".

Notice that we must _initialize_ the variable to zero before we start counting. 

```python3
# 19
# Try this:
fruits = ["strawberry", "raspberry", "blueberry", "grape", "mango", "melon"]
berryCount = 0
for fr in fruits:
    if fr.endswith("berry"):
        berryCount += 1
print("I've finished counting the fruits.")
print(f"There were {berryCount} that ended with berry.")


# 20
# Using `startswith` (which works quite similarly to endswith),
# count how many of the fruits start with 'm'.
# Then display the count.


# 21
# Given this list, count how many temperatures are above freezing.
# Display the count.
temps_in_F = [90, 47, 82, 68, 100, 30, 25, 40]



# 22
# Copy and modify the previous example to show the user how many
# temperatures are above freezing and how many are below freezing.
```

Often, you may work with related sets of data. For example, imagine a list of instructors, their ages, and their years of experience. You may do a list of lists:

```python3
instructors = [["Maria", 38, 7], ["Walton", 47, 22], ["Martin", 52, 18],
                  ["Joel", 28, 3], ["Tate", 67, 5]]
```

To work with this list, we may use a for loop:

```python3
# 23
# Try this.
print("Here is my instructor data:")
for name, age, yearsExp in instructors:
    print(f"The instructor {name} is {age} years old and has {yearsExp} years of experience.")
```

Let's do some math inside of the loop.

```python3
# 24
# Copy and modify the previous example to display how old each person was when he/she started this job. For example, Maria started this job 7 years ago, so you would print this:
#    The instructor Maria is 38 years old, and started working at age 31.


# 25
# Copy and modify the previous example to display each person's name and salary.
# Compute the salary using this formula:
#   For 0 to 4 years, the pay is $35000.
#   For 5 to 9 years, the pay is $36000.
#   For 10 to 14 years, the pay is $37000.
#   etc.
# Hint: use floor division (the // operator) to compute the salary.
#       It will resemble this:  salary = base_pay + pay_adjustment * (years_of_exp // 5)
# Example: 
#     Maria: 7 years of experience, $36000 per year


# 26
# Copy and modify the previous example.
# Ask the user for...
#  - the base pay, and
#  - the amount of pay adjustment per 5 years of experience.


# 27
# Copy and modify the previous example.
# After the for loop, display
#    "The total amount of work experience for this team is ___". 
# Must compute the total inside the for loop.
# Hint: the structure will resemble this:
#   totalYearsExp = 0
#   for ... in ...:
#       ...
#       totalYearsExp += yearsExp
#       ...
#   print(f"The total amount of work experience for this team is {totalYearsExp}")
```

## Optional exercises

If you have time, we recommend doing the exercises below.

```python3
# 22b
# Try this.
names = ["Sam", "Lisa", "Micah", "Dave"]
for indx, elem in enumerate(names):
    print(f"The index is {indx} and the element is {elem}")


# 23
# Now, let's experiment with counting.
# Modify the earlier example (the one that printed "Hello" with "!" after each letter) so it outputs the 
#  indices of the letters before the letters.
# Hint: One way to do this is using enumerate.

# Example output:

# 0: H!
# 1: e!
# 2: l!
# 3: l!
# 4: o!
# Etc.


# -- Introduction to the next few questions --
# Your spectrum analyzer is logging which frequencies have shown activity.
# It makes a note of the center frequency of each burst of activity.
# Here’s what it has recorded (units are MHz):
freqs = [2403.6, 101.3, 90.1, 5.2, 2410.2, 3.7]

# 24
# Using a loop, print each frequency, and then print whether it is
# in the Wi-Fi range, the FM Radio range, or Neither Wi-Fi nor FM.


# 25
# Modify the previous example to count how many frequencies were in each category.
# At the end of the program, print the count for each category.


# 26
# A report is being produced which only shows detected Wi-Fi frequencies.
# Make a copy of the previous program that only prints the Wi-Fi frequencies from the list.


# 27
# After having read the report, someone wants to know where in the list that the Wi-Fi
# frequencies occur. Make a program that prints both Wi-Fi frequencies and their indices.
# You'll most likely want to use the enumerate function.

# Expected output:
# 2403.6 MHz: index 0
# 2410.2 MHz: index 4


# 28
# Some of the audience of the report is unfamiliar with MHz.
# Modify one (any one) of the above spectrum-related questions
# to allow the user to choose if they want to see the results in MHz or GHz.
# Then print the frequencies using the chosen unit.


# 29
# Someone now wants a program to convert between MHz and GHz.
# The person wants to be able to type everything in one prompt, for example,

#   What would you like to convert? 3445 MHz
#   That is 3.445 GHz.

# Convert appropriately from MHz to GHz or vice versa using input from a single prompt.
# Note 1: the following exercise provides a useful hint.
# Note 2: You can assume the user enters valid data, or, for a challenge, check for data validity.


# 30
# Try this:
userdata = input("Enter two numbers, separated by a space.")
a, b = userdata.split()
print(f"First number: {a} and second number: {b}")


# 31
# In some cases, you can use the filter function instead of a `for` loop.
# Example:
temps_in_F = [90, 47, 82, 68, 100, 30, 25, 40]
warm_temps = list(filter(lambda x: x > 81, temps_in_F))
print(warm_temps)
```

## Challenge Questions
If you are limited in time or most students are ahead of you, postpone or skip this section.

```python3
# 32a nested for-loops  (previously numbered as 11b)
# Display multiplication facts from 1 to 5:
# 1 * 1 = 1
# 1 * 2 = 2
# ...
# 1 * 5 = 5
# ...
# 3 * 4 = 12
# ...
# 5 * 1 = 5
# ...
# 5 * 5 = 25

# 32b nested for-loops -- Multiplication table 
# Using the nested for-loops you created to display multiplication facts from 1 to 5 (above),
# display the results in a table:
#
#    | 1   2   3   4   5
#  --|------------------
#  1 | 1   2   3   4   5
#  2 | 2   4   6   8  10
#  etc.
# 
# Hint, to print multiple results on same line try this:
print(f"{result}", end=' ') 
# Where "result" is the multiplication you want to display)
# The "end = ' ' " string causes the automatic carriage return to be overted
# Add an empty print() statement to add a carriage return to move down to the next line.
```
