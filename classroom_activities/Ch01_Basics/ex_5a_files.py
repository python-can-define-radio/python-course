# Using Python,
# Ask the user for name and age.

# When opening a file in Python, if you don't specify a mode, Python will default to 'read' mode ('r'). 
# So, this is equivalent to the previous example:

print(contents)
f.close()


# 6
# The 'write' mode ('w') will create a new file if the specified file does not exist, or overwrite the contents of the file if it does exist.

# Now let's read the file

# Now write into the file again but with different text

# Now let's read the file again for proof that the original text was overwritten.
f = open("yay_new_file.txt")
contents = f.read()
print(contents)
f.close()


# 7
# If you want to be more cautious, you can use "x" instead of "w", 
# which will give an error if the file already exists (rather than overwriting it).
f = open("yay_new_file.txt", "x")
f.write("Words to put in the file\n")
f.close()


# 8
# If you want to write at the end of a file ("append"), you can use "a".
